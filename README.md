The repository contains a dataset we constructed for a multi-label syndrome differentiation task in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).

Due to the sensitivity of medical data, we will make the dataset publicly available as soon as we obtain permission from the hospital, which is expected to take approximately 2-3 months.

For now, we have only provided three sample entries along with the code for classification using large model inference capabilities, for those interested in exploring the task.
